"""The query path, step by step: the heart of v2.

What goes here:
    - ``AnswerPipeline``, constructed with every collaborator injected
      (retriever, reranker, llm, prompts, cache, groundedness scorer,
      calibrator, trace store, settings). It never constructs them itself.
    - ``async answer(question, history=None, bypass_cache=False) -> Answer``
    - ``async stream(question, history=None) -> AsyncIterator[StreamEvent]``

What it must do, in order:
    1. new trace_id; condense the question if there is history
    2. cache lookup (exact, then semantic); on hit, return / replay as a stream
    3. hybrid retrieval -> rerank -> abstain decision (no LLM call if abstaining)
    4. render the versioned prompt with numbered chunks; generate or stream
    5. validate citations; score sentence groundedness; compute confidence
    6. save the ExplanationTrace; store in cache; record RequestSignals
    7. return timings for every step (retrieval_ms, ttft_ms, total_ms)

Must not:
    - import Groq, Chroma, Redis or Streamlit directly (only via interfaces),
      or know anything about HTTP.

Tested by: tests/integration/test_pipeline.py (FakeLLM + HashEmbedder,
mini corpus): answers with citations, abstains on off-topic questions,
cache hit on repeat, stream events arrive in the documented order.
Phase: 1 (answer), 2 (explain hooks), 3 (stream)
